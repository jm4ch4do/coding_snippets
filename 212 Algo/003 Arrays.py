# -------------------------ARRAYS TYPES-------------------------
# three types of arrays:
# List: [1, 2, 3]     # use extra espace but allow many operations
# Tuple: (1, 2, 3)    # use little space but allow few operations
# String: '123'       # simple to use
# they all support indexing t[0]=1

# Hast tables
# dict
# set  a simplified implementation with the same properties
