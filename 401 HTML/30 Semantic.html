<!---------------------- SEMANTIC ELEMENTS ---------------------->
<!-- Semanctic Elements have no effect on the presentation of the content
     They only serve as a guide to identifying the purpose of the element
     They were introduced in HTML5

       <header>
        <nav>

  <section>
              <aside>
  <article>

       <footer>
 
  <header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
  <nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
  <section> - Defines a section in a document
  <article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
  <aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
  <footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
  <details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
  <summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element


  There are basically 4 techniques to create multicolumn layouts.

  CSS Frameworks -> Use Bootstrap, is the faster way.
  CSS Float -> It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. 
               Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and 
               clear properties work. Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to 
               the document flow, which may harm the flexibility.
  CSS Flexbox -> Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page
                 layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.
  CSS Grid -> The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and
              columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats 
              and positioning.
