# Infrastructure as code (IaC): Provisioning infrastructure through
# software to achiveve consistent and predictable deployments

# Terraforms allows automating the deployment of infrastructure in 
# multiple providers both from public and private cloud

# Terraform uses declarative approach, meaning it defines JSONs and 
# other data structures to declare what it wants to do, instead of
# using function and parameters which will be an imperative approach
# Terraform uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Languague) that is very
# similar to JSON, or it can also use pure JSON

# Terraform is Idempotent: If you make changes for your environment
# once it will work but if you try again it will let you know that
# this changes already occurred so is like Terraform has some kind
# of intelligence to avoid making mistakes

# Why use Terraform:
# Automated Deployement
# Repeatable Process
# Consistent environments
# Reusable components
# Documented architecture
